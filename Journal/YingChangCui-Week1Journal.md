Week 1 Accomplishment:

  My team and I established our overall architecture of our entire project and made a diagram for easy understanding. My portion of the project will be mainly focused
  on the Cashier Application. So far, I have made the home page of the Cashier App which has the text and images of all the category of drinks.

Week 1 Challenges:

  Initially, I thought we were going to be editting the nodejs file so I started working on the cashier app in nodejs and had to make the transition to spring web. Another
  challenge was learning html because I didn't have any prior experience before this class.
