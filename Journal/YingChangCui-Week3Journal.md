Week 3 Accomplishment:

  All the html files are finalized and the changes I made are being about to customize the order, redirect the pages so it can go into different categories and added a submit
  button so we can submit the orders to the api. I merged the cashier app branch to the main branch so I can coordinate with my teammates for the api implementation.

Week 3 Challenges:
  
  The only challenge for this week was coordinating with my teammates to meet up because everyone has a different schedule so we had to reschedule a few times.
