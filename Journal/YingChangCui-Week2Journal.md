Week 2 Accomplishment:

  Throughout this week, I created new html files in which they would display all the drinks. The four categories in the html file are: Hot Coffee, Hot Tea, Hot Drinks, 
  and Frappuccino. All the images and text are updated in the html files so I can implement generating a new order next week. Another task I worked on was making a clear order
  button so I can make the API call to update all the orders in the database.
